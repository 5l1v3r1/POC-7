Why is this code important?
Because it is one of the few codes that will give shellcode output 
that bypasses up-to-date Windows AV. (10/2/2018) As far as I know, 
Veil does not output shellcode so it doesn't compete in the same scope.


Why is this released under POC and not Malware_Tools?
Because this code has too many issues to be a real code. Even though it does
its job, I don't want to continue this project. If you open the salvage.rb
you will see it's many flaws in it's known security vulnerabilities.
 I would rather just restart the project, fixing the issues as I go along 
 and of course, write it in C++, windows style like 'Cane & Able'.


Why release it at all?
I wasn't going to initially, but I said I would to too many people so here
it is in alls its glory :)


Comments in code?
Yeah, I left those in to help an confuse you.
Some of them may be inaccurate, don't rely on them too much.

Enjoy :)
